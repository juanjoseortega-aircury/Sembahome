        The EM consulting and software development company <a href="https://www.elemwave.com">Elemwave</a> has developed a GUI which simplifies the process of generating problems for the <a href="https://github.com/OpenSEMBA/fdtd">SEMBA FDTD solver</a>. 
        The tool is integrated within FreeCAD and allows to define typical EMC problems such as: lightning sources, electromagnetic coupling with cable bundles, voltage surges, etc.
